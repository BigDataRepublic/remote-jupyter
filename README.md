Remote Jupyter
===========

Simple REST service with updatable handler function to run inside a Jupyter Python 3 notebook allowing for runtime update of the handler function while the REST service stays up.

Why
----

To allow for a Jupyter Notebook to control the [Elevator programming challange](http://play.elevatorsaga.com/). Just as an experiment.
